# etch-a-sketch

In this project I will create a square grid that color in when hovered over with the mouse. There is very little hand holding in this exercise which I am happy about as it will provide me with a good opportunity to improve my research skills on google and stack overflow. I am also excited for the challenge. I will create the initial etch and sketch and then add css once I have the functionality in place.
